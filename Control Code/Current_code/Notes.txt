# Upcoming Tasks:
# T1. Modify the screw-driving order (currently in a Z-shape pattern)
#     Suggested pattern modification:
#     For the subsequent weaving process, we need to start from a fixed point,
#     so consider fixing one screw at the center of the rectangle!!!
# DONE!

# T2. Encapsulate the Wound_nail function
#     Issue:
#     During weaving, if we need to use joint 5 to control the end-effector orientation,
#     we must ensure that the orientation remains unchanged during movement —
#     check the user guide.
# Done!

# T3. Mathematical modeling:
#     Control the end-effector orientation through joint 5.fun

# T4. Convert the modeling in T3 into executable code.

# Tips:
# Check the key names, make sure they are all defined
# Jupyter lab cannot access arduino port. So, can only use Commend or python IDLE

# Fishished Testing the function: `set_joint_6`

# Function: `begin_segment_snapshot_orientation` wasn't teasted
